mongoRest
=========

Simple REST server for MongoDb.  Currently DEV only.  Not for development use 

This is an adaptation of the [mongodbRest](https://github.com/tdegrunt/mongodb-rest.git) project byt [tdegrunt](https://github.com/tdegrunt)

This project allows basic CRUD operations on a generic mongo database.  Very easy to use.
